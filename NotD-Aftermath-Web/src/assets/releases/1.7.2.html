<p>Following up on the last version, this is another small incremental release. There are a few difficulty adjustments to Hell, including a new boss variation and some minor spawn adjustments. A new experimental boss spawning system is now in place to prevent spawns too close to players, it may require some adjustments in the next few releases. This version also includes an automatic trigger safety system to prevent privates and leavers from attacking allies. Some ability and item icons have been updated to be HD or replaced entirely. Lastly, a few long standing bugs (and some very recent ones) have been fixed.</p>
