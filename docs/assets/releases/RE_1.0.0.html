<h2>General Theme of Change</h2>

<ul>
    <li>New release branch of the map</li>
    <li>Code cleanup and improvements</li>
    <li>Bug fixes</li>
    <li>Gameplay changes</li>
</ul>

<p>This version does not contain every single feature and fix that people have requested changing from 1.6a, but I wanted to have an early release as baseline for further development.</p>
<p>Please consider this very much an early beta, I expect that there will be many bugs due to the amount of changes and the fact that this was created from 1.5c insted of 1.6a directly.</p>
