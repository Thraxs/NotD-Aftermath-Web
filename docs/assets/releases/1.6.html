<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You no longer have to type -view after completing a mission to reset your camera.</li>
    <li>Improved the detection of when a unit is alive or not. It should be 100% accurate now. This has the potential to fix some random, rare bugs. Currently only applied to Chapter 1.</li>
    <li>The "-clear" command no longer clears messages for all players (Spinaker).</li>
    <li>Fixed a fatal error that would happen within the first few minutes of the game due to handle stack corruption. This may also fix more random crashes.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in Revelations where you could get stuck in Chapter 2 if you didn't kill the bosses in the correct order (Spinaker).</li>
    <li>Fixed a fatal error that could occur if Residence 41 died before the EM Sphere releases.</li>
    <li>You can no longer play as the Marine Corp or the Civilians by using a hostbot.</li>
    <li>Fire Mission base damage updated from 300 to 400 (Spinaker).</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where you could get stuck floating in the air while using Jump.</li>
    <li>Detonating a MD5 Mine on a unit with Napalm no longer crashes the game.</li>
</ul>
